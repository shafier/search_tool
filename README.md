# search_tool
## Searching across multiple files and file types using Python except DS_Store, docx , xlsx, pdf

*I had in my mind a keyword or keywords that I would use them in default search function installed in the computer. Sometimes these searches worked when there were not many files involved, or the search function cannot read certain file types.

*Leveraging my existing knowledge on Python and the world wide web, I built a prototype search tool. The tool works but it does not read DS_Store, docx , xlsx, pdf file types

*To achieve this objective, I worked with os library, striprtf package, shutil package

*During the project, one of the learning experiences is that if you created a file via TextEdit (I am using Mac OS) and copied it to a new file, then the new file contains rft format. 
*Therefore, I had to convert this rtf format to text format using striprft.
